# RegexSoupMiner: HTML Data Parser

This is a HTML Data Mining project built with Regex and BeautifulSoup to extract and parse raw HTML data into intuitive tabular CSVs. They were then cleaned up in Pandas to remove unwanted characters and symbols. The workflow was done from beginning to end keeping in mind that we had to get the maximum possible data out of those html.



## üöÄ Result

We retained **99%** of the data from `flip_data` through Regular Expressions due to their fixed structure. For `meat_data`, we retrieved **100%** of the data using BeautifulSoup due its variable structure.



## ‚úè Tech Stack for Project Development

- Python
- Pandas
- BeautifulSoup
